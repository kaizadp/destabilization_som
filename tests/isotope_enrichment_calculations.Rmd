Calculations for isotope enrichment.  
Change input parameters for soil (step 1) and for substrate (step 3). 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

soil name: Palouse  
45/44-R: 0.0188  
TC = 2 %  



```{r}
## INPUT VARIABLES FOR SOIL 

soil_name = "MOPANG"
R_45_44 = 0.0191 # 45/44 isotope ratio
core_wt = 100 # grams
soil_tc = 0.09 # total carbon 9 %
soil_weoc = 0.06 # water-extractable organic carbon, mg C/g soil
```

#### step 1: how much carbon to add?

in a `r core_wt`-g core,  
total carbon = `r core_wt*soil_tc` g.  
WEOC =  `r soil_weoc*core_wt` mgC.  

if we add C substrate equivalent to the WEOC,  
we **add `r soil_weoc*core_wt` mg C** to the `r core_wt`-g core.

---

#### step 2: what enrichment do we want for the added carbon?
We want our final enrichmment in the soil = 0.1 (i.e. 10 %).  
So how much enriched substrate do we need to add?  
```{r}
AT = 0.10 # target enrichment
A1 = R_45_44 # R-value for initial soil
# A2 = ?

M1 = soil_weoc * core_wt # initial C, grams
M2 = soil_weoc*core_wt # added C, grams
```

AT = ((A1 x M1) + (A2 x M2)) / (M1 + M2)  
so 
A2  = ((AT x (M1+M2)) - (A1 x M1)) / M2  
```{r}
A2 = ((AT *(M1+M2)) - (A1*M1))/M2
print(A2)
```

**so we need to add `r M2` mg C at `r A2` enrichment.**

---

#### step 3: how will we prepare this enriched substrate?

we will mix labelled + unlabelled substrate to get this value

## substrate 1: dextrose

```{r dextrose}
## INPUT VARIABLES FOR SUBSTRATE
substrate = "DEXTROSE"
A_labelled = 0.99
A_unlabelled = 0.0191 # assuming for now

mole_substrate = (12*6) + (1*12) + (16*6) # molar weight of substrate
mole_carbon = 12* 6 # molar weight of carbon in substrate
carbon_atoms = 6
c_fraction = mole_carbon/mole_substrate
```

How much labelled + unlabelled substrate should we mix to get the target enrichment?

M_labelled + M_unlabelled = M2  

M_unlabelled = `r M2` - M_labelled  

solve for M_labelled

A2 = ((A_labelled x M_labelled) + (A_unlabelled x M_unlabelled)) / (M_labelled + M_unlabelled)  
```{r label}
M_labelled = ((A2*M2) - (A_unlabelled*M2)) / (A_labelled - A_unlabelled)
M_unlabelled = M2 - M_labelled
print(M_labelled)
print(M_unlabelled)
```

**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched CARBON with `r round(M_unlabelled,2)` mg of unlabelled CARBON (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  

our substrate is `r substrate`,  
where `r mole_carbon` g C corresponds to `r mole_substrate` g substrate.  

---  

#### conclusion
**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched substrate with `r round(M_unlabelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of unlabelled substrate (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  
**to get `r M2/c_fraction` mg of `r A2` enriched substrate -- for a `r core_wt`-g soil core.**

## substrate 2: salicylic acid

```{r sal}
## INPUT VARIABLES FOR SUBSTRATE
substrate = "SALICYLIC ACID"
A_labelled = 0.99
A_unlabelled = 0.0191 # assuming for now

mole_substrate = (12*7) + (1*6) + (16*3) # molar weight of substrate
mole_carbon = 12* 7 # molar weight of carbon in substrate
carbon_atoms = 7
c_fraction = mole_carbon/mole_substrate
```

How much labelled + unlabelled substrate should we mix to get the target enrichment?

M_labelled + M_unlabelled = M2  

M_unlabelled = `r M2` - M_labelled  

solve for M_labelled

A2 = ((A_labelled x M_labelled) + (A_unlabelled x M_unlabelled)) / (M_labelled + M_unlabelled)  
```{r label2}
M_labelled = ((A2*M2) - (A_unlabelled*M2)) / (A_labelled - A_unlabelled)
M_unlabelled = M2 - M_labelled
print(M_labelled)
print(M_unlabelled)
```

**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched CARBON with `r round(M_unlabelled,2)` mg of unlabelled CARBON (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  

our substrate is `r substrate`,  
where `r mole_carbon` g C corresponds to `r mole_substrate` g substrate.  

---  

#### conclusion
**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched substrate with `r round(M_unlabelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of unlabelled substrate (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  
**to get `r M2/c_fraction` mg of `r A2` enriched substrate -- for a `r core_wt`-g soil core.**

## substrate 3: oxalic acid

```{r oxalic}
## INPUT VARIABLES FOR SUBSTRATE
substrate = "OXALIC ACID"
A_labelled = 0.99
A_unlabelled = 0.0191 # assuming for now

mole_substrate = (12*2) + (1*2) + (16*4) # molar weight of substrate
mole_carbon = 12* 2 # molar weight of carbon in substrate
carbon_atoms = 2
c_fraction = mole_carbon/mole_substrate
```

How much labelled + unlabelled substrate should we mix to get the target enrichment?

M_labelled + M_unlabelled = M2  

M_unlabelled = `r M2` - M_labelled  

solve for M_labelled

A2 = ((A_labelled x M_labelled) + (A_unlabelled x M_unlabelled)) / (M_labelled + M_unlabelled)  
```{r label3}
M_labelled = ((A2*M2) - (A_unlabelled*M2)) / (A_labelled - A_unlabelled)
M_unlabelled = M2 - M_labelled
print(M_labelled)
print(M_unlabelled)
```

**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched CARBON with `r round(M_unlabelled,2)` mg of unlabelled CARBON (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  

our substrate is `r substrate`,  
where `r mole_carbon` g C corresponds to `r mole_substrate` g substrate.  

---  

#### conclusion
**so, we will mix `r round(M_labelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of `r A_labelled` enriched substrate with `r round(M_unlabelled/c_fraction,2)` mg of unlabelled substrate (`r A_unlabelled` enriched),**  
**to get `r M2/c_fraction` mg of `r A2` enriched substrate -- for a `r core_wt`-g soil core.**
